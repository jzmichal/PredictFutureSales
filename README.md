# PredictFutureSales
Kaggle Competition corresponding to the final project for the "How to win a data science competition" Coursera class. I worked with a challenging time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. Given roughly 3 years of chronological daily sales data with indexed store and item combinations, The task was to predict total sales for every product and store in the month following the end of the training data. I used data visualization techniques to first clean the data, and then recognize trends for feature engineering later on. I created a new data matrix utilizing a combination of features from the given dataframes, as well as feature engineering with mean encodings, lag based features, one hot encodings, and intuitive combinations of existing features. After parameter testing and fine tuning xgboost, lightgbm, catboost, ridge regression, two two-layer neural networks, and random forest, I stacked all of these models together with linear regression to create a meta model that trained on each of these models predictions for shop/item combinations during the training and test period in order to predict the desired test data for the month following the end of the training data.
